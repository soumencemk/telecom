At a high level, telecom charging works by monitoring and monetizing the services users consume, such as voice calls, data usage, and SMS. Here’s a step-by-step overview of how it functions:

1. **Event Detection**: Every time a user initiates an activity (like making a call, sending a message, or using data), the network detects it as a "chargeable event."

2. **Authorization**: The charging system checks if the user has sufficient balance or an active subscription. For prepaid users, this check happens in real-time via the Online Charging System (OCS) to ensure the balance can cover the intended activity.

3. **Usage Tracking**: As the user continues the activity, the system monitors usage. For example, in a data session, it tracks the amount of data used over time.

4. **Rate Calculation (Rating)**: Based on the user's plan and the type of service used, a "rating engine" calculates the cost. This rate can vary by factors like time, location, and promotions.

5. **Balance Update**: The user's balance is updated immediately (for prepaid) or recorded for later billing (for postpaid). For prepaid users, if the balance runs out during an activity, the service is cut off or limited.

6. **Record Creation**: The system creates a detailed log (Call Detail Record for calls, Usage Detail Record for data) that includes the user’s usage details, service type, duration, and cost. 

7. **Billing (for Postpaid)**: At the end of the billing cycle, all records for postpaid users are processed, and a bill is generated based on their total usage for the period.

8. **Notifications and Alerts**: The system may notify users about their usage, remaining balance, or when they approach limits on data or call quotas.

This framework allows telecom operators to control access to services in real-time, accurately bill users based on their usage, and apply discounts or special offers efficiently.
